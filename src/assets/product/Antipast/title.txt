Launched in 1991 by Japanese textile designers Junko Jinushi and Kyoto Kato, ANTIPAST is a range of colorful, textured everyday pieces designed, as the label’s name suggests, to excite the wearer’s appetite for forward-thinking design. Floral-jacquard knee socks, easy knit cardigans and pullovers, and a lace-embroidered velveteen coat are but a few of ANTIPAST’s collectible passages for the fall-winter season.
