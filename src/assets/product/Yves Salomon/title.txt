A modern fur maison, French label Yves Salomon carries with it a storied legacy. After being exiled from Russia in 1910, Gregory Salomon learned the art of fur trading in Siberia. Salomon and his son spent more than 60 years purchasing skins for prominent fashion houses before his grandson Yves formed the label in 1972. In its modern incarnation, Yves Salomon crafts directional pieces from the finest skins, often combined with other materials for a modern edge. Furs are updated every season under the direction of the creative and artisanal workshops.
