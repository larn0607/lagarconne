Shorthand for “Anonymous Dystopia,” ADNYM—a gender-neutral label founded in Stockholm in 2016 by three seasoned denim veterans, one of whom founded Hope—mines the idea of dressing anonymously in a highly uncertain world. While ADNYM is best known for subverting the codes of the traditional five-pocket jean, the brand is also a go-to for outsized tees, hoodies, and tailored pieces with both Scandi-minimalist and Middle Eastern influences. Spring/Summer 2020 sees a focus on slouchy, elongated ribbed knits and slim-fitting cropped jeans in a mostly black palette.
