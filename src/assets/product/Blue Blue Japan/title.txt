Launched in 1996 as the in-house denim range of Okura, a Tokyo-based clothing and textile store, Blue Blue Japan uses traditional Japanese techniques—from proprietary artisan washes to sashiko stitching—to create a sharply executed daily uniform that transcends the indigo-dyed denim for which the label is also known. This fall-winter, Blue Blue Japan presents tweed and double-melton outerwear; jacquard-woven slip-over dresses; wide-leg corduroy trousers; and whimsical knit socks and beanies in an austere neutral palette with sporadic pops of red.
