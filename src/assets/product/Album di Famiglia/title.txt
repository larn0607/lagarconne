Founded in 2000 by designer Monica Rusconi, Album di Famiglia is a minimalist, family-run ready-to-wear label with a committed focus on relaxed shapes, high-quality textiles, and local Italian production. Everyday pieces like cropped drawstring trousers, wide-cut T-shirts, and cocoon-like knits are intended for long-term wear, and designed to evoke lifeâ€™s simple pleasures. The entire collection is conceived and sustainably produced in small Italian workshops.
