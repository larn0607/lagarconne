6397 was launched in 2012 by Stella Ishii, founder of fashion showroom The News. A natural extension of Ishii’s own wardrobe, the core line consists of basics with slightly boyish silhouettes—think pared-down denim crafted in high-quality Italian cotton and meticulously fit tees. All pieces seamlessly mix and match in quintessential American style.
