Comme des Garçons
Comme des Garçons was founded by self–taught, iconoclast Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo. Deconstruction, asymmetry, avant–garde tailoring, and a poignant use of black characterize Kawakubo’s radical design approach. Recent collections feature CDG mainstays, including oversized silhouettes, textural knit details, leather oxfords, colorful abstract prints, peter pan collar button downs, and full skirts, in navy, white and signature black.
