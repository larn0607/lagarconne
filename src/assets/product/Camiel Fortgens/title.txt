An industrial designer by trade, Amsterdam-based Camiel Fortgens dissects ready-to-wear archetypes as a contrarian outsider, in an effort to understand how and why they came to be. This fall season, Fortgens sharpens his focus on amply cut gender-neutral styles—often with unfinished edges—which include long-sleeve cotton tees and button-ups, pull-on corduroy trousers, and a hand-painted floral silk-twill passage that can be worn as a dress or a coat.
