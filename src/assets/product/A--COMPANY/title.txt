Established in 2018 by designer Sara Lopez, a South Texas native who studied couture dressmaking in Paris under the tutelage of Anne ValÃ©rie Hash and Yohji Yamamoto, A--Company is a New York-based conceptual brand that reinterprets garments that have remained relatively unchanged over the decades. The textiles used are sustainable and traceable, and, in an effort to eliminate waste, each design is produced in the Garment District in a limited quantity of 144. This spring season, Sara and her expert patternmakers present draped asymmetric dresses in silk jersey and faille, off-kilter cotton shirting, and a mixed-media trench coat of gabardine and acid-wash denim.
