Established by French workwear manufacturer Gabriel Danton in 1935, the Danton brand supplied laborers in the center and northeast of France with overalls, cook’s jackets, blousons, and gardening aprons for more than half a century. Now headquartered in Japan, the revitalized label—recognizable by its red-and-white diamond-logo appliqué—offers a core collection of unisex workwear-inspired styles subtly informed by Japanese design, including wide-cut cotton button-ups, durable canvas bags, and signature down-quilted taffeta jackets, coats, and vests.
